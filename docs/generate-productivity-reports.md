# Generate Productivity Reports

Build customizable reports on blocked and tracked time to uncover productivity patterns and optimize your workflow. Discover how much time you're spending on meetings and other events.

## Goal: Overcoming the Planning Fallacy

Underestimating the time needed to complete tasks is something we all tend to do, which is so common it's called the [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy). A proven method to counteract this is by estimating time based on actual outcomes from similar past actions.

Productivity Reports provide objective data on these actual outcomes, allowing you to confront the reality of your time management. By comparing the time spent on tasks with your initial time block estimates, you'll progressively refine your estimation skills, resulting in more accurate time blocking.

## Report Item Status

### With Time Tracking & Grouping

When the [Time Tracking App](extension-settings#time-tracking-app) is set up correctly, and the [Group To-Dos by Spontaneity](#group-to-dos-by-spontaneity) option is enabled, the productivity report displays item statuses based on the following criteria:

| Item Status               | Todo Status  | Time Blocked?[^1]      | Time Tracked? |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Completed as Scheduled    | ‚úÖ Completed | üìÖ Yes                 | ‚è±Ô∏è / ‚¨ö Either |
| Completed Spontaneously   | ‚úÖ Completed | ‚¨ö No                   | ‚è±Ô∏è / ‚¨ö Either |
| Progressing as Scheduled  | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | üìÖ Yes                 | ‚è±Ô∏è Yes        |
| Progressing Spontaneously | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | ‚¨ö No                   | ‚è±Ô∏è Yes        |
| Upcoming                  | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | üìÖ Future[^2]          | ‚¨ö No          |
| Missed                    | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | üìÖ Past[^3] / ‚¨ö No[^4] | ‚¨ö No          |

[^1]: Time Blocked indicates whether the to-do was scheduled as a time block, as part of a task block containing one or more to-dos, or not scheduled at all.
[^2]: The to-do is scheduled, and it's before the scheduled time.
[^3]: The to-do is scheduled, and it's past the scheduled time.
[^4]: Only if the [Show Unscheduled & Open To-Dos](#show-unscheduled--open-to-dos) option is checked.

### With Time Blocks Only

When the [Time Tracking App](extension-settings#time-tracking-app) is not set up, or the [Group To-Dos by Spontaneity](#group-to-dos-by-spontaneity) option is disabled, the productivity report displays item statuses based on the following criteria:

| Item Status | Todo Status  | Time Blocked?[^1] |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Completed   | ‚úÖ Completed | üìÖ Yes            |
| Progressing | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | üìÖ Past[^3]       |
| Upcoming    | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | üìÖ Future[^2]     |
| Missed      | ‚¨úÔ∏è Open     | ‚¨ö No[^4]          |

## Tracked Time Allocation

Time tracked for task blocks is distributed evenly among the to-dos within the task blocks. When there are multiple time entries for a task block or if a task block is scheduled multiple times, the allocation of tracked time depends on the [Time Tracking App](extension-settings#time-tracking-app):

- **Calendar (URL-based allocation)**: The total tracked time from all entries with the same URL is divided equally among the to-dos embedded in that URL.
- **Toggl/Clockify (title-based allocation)**: The total tracked time from all entries with the same title is allocated to the to-dos within the task blocks that share the same title. The allocation is weighted by the duration of each time block.

## Meetings & Other Calendar Events

In the Other group, up to four types of subgroups may appear, if such blocks or events are present:

- **Break Blocks**: Break blocks scheduled using the extension.
- **Personal Events**: Calendar events without organizers or attendees.
- **Meetings**: Calendar events you organized or were invited to.
- **Open Task Blocks**: Task blocks scheduled without any associated to-dos. These cannot be created within the extension, but can be created by manually editing the calendar event URL.

Any time entries that are not associated with any to-dos or events won't be included in productivity reports.

## Command Preferences

### Exclude Weekends

Exclude to-dos, calendar events, and time entries occurring[^5] on Saturdays and Sundays from the reports. If `true`, nothing will show up in the reports even if you specifically set the report period to a weekend day. The default is `false`.

### Show Unscheduled & Open To-Dos

Include incomplete to-dos that have not been assigned a time block or tracked in the generated reports. The default is `false`.

### Group To-Dos by Spontaneity

Group to-dos based on whether they were completed as scheduled (with assigned time/task blocks) or spontaneously (without assigned time/task blocks). The default is `true`.

[^5]: For to-dos, "occurring" means that either the completion date, start date, or due date falls on a Saturday or Sunday. For calendar events and time entries, "occurring" means the start date falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
