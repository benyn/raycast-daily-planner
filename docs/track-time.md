# Track Time for To-Dos

## Command Preferences

- **Update Start/Due Date on Timer Start**: If a timer for a task is started earlier than its start date (Reminders/Things) or due date (Todoist), update the start/due date. If started later, the start/due date always remains unchanged. The default is `true`.
