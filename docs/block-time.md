# Block Time for To-Dos

## Command Preferences

- **Default Time Block Duration**: Default length for blocks (calendar events) created for to-dos. The default is "1 hour".
- **Working Hours Start Time**: The earliest time of the day at which time block scheduling suggestions should start. The default is "9:00 AM".
- **Working Hours End Time**: The latest time of the day at which time block scheduling suggestions should end. The default is "5:00 PM".
- **Time Block Alert Timing**: Your preferred timing for alerts about upcoming time blocks. The alerts will come from the macOS Calendar app, not Raycast. The default is ""2 minutes before".
- **Task Block Name**: Default title for a calendar event representing a block of time set aside for multiple small tasks. You can change the name of task blocks in the Calendar app. Task blocks will be grouped by title. Time entries created before a name change wonâ€™t be updated. The default is "Task Block".
- **Update Start/Due Date on Time Blocking**: If a task is time-blocked for a date earlier than its start date (Reminders/Things) or due date (Todoist), update the start/due date. If time-blocked for a later date, the start/due date always remains unchanged. The default is `true`.
